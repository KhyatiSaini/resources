## Why does this site exist? 🤔

As Computer Science and Information Technology Undergraduates, we spend most of our time around softwares. With the huge amount of information available online, it can be quite overwhelming to decide what tools and technologies to learn to use next.

When one of us comes across something that has been of use to them, it is highly possible that it can be of use to someone else too. That's why we decided to come up with a place to collect all such resources that have been useful to us and make it available for everybody.

This page is divided into several topics. Clicking on the topic names open the corresponding page.

Have fun exploring 🖖
